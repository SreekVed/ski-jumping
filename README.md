# Ski Jumping Simulator

A command-line Ski Jumping simulation game in Java that can be played with an unlimited number of players for any number of rounds.

The jumpers jump in ascending order of points, so the one with the lowest points jumps first, while the one with the highest points jumps last.

Five judges vote for each jump, and the points for each round are awarded by adding the votes of three judges to the jump length.

When the player chooses to end the tournament, the final results are printed on the screen with the players sorted in descending order of their points. The individual jump lengths from every round are also shown for each player.
